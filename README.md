# Mobile Native App Project

## Summary:

•	The primary goal of the MNA promo email test was to encourage new Direct and Agent customers to download the app. The underlying assumption was that by adopting self-servicing, we can empower our customers to manage their policies independently, thereby increasing our operational efficiency and retention.

•	Targeted groups were new Direct and Agent customers who have never logged into the app before.

•	This analysis covers cohorts from August 31, 2023, to February 29, 2024. Note that this is an ongoing test, and a follow-up should be expected early in June 2024.
